## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
For the DriverPass Project, the client was a company called DriverPass. They wanted a web based application focused on teaching student drivers how to drive. It would have exams, practice exams, as well as a practical driving lesson handled by an instructor. These appointments would all be tracked by the website. Varying levels of packages should be available so the customer can find something suitable.
## What did you do particularly well?
I feel like I did a pretty good job on the business requirements document. I think that I covered most of the bases and got enough detail in for each step. I also think I did a pretty good job on my activity diagrams. 
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise my work on the sequence diagram. I noticed that my diagram lacks the depth that a lot of the examples I found online had. I may have just chosen a poor Use case however. 
## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I tried to keep all of the user's needs from the interview into the design. The only one which I found issue with was the "offline functionality" as I feel like it clashes with my choice of cloud hosting the site. The project is based on what the client/users want, so it's important to focus on what they want/need. Ensuring that most of their needs are met is important to ensuring that your client is happy with the product you deliver.
## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I approached software design by following the templates that the course provided. Outlining the system's requirements, brainstorming process models, coming up with UML diagrams, and looking at the systems technical needs were all imporant when trying to ensure the project's success. I think that I would try to ensure that all of these steps are followed in the future.
